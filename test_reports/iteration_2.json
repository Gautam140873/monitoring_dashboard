  "summary": "Completed comprehensive testing of SkillFlow Dashboard bug fixes. All reported issues have been resolved: 1) SDC detail page now loads correctly when clicking on SDC cards (previously showed 403 error for 'sdc' role users), 2) New Work Order form dialog works correctly from Dashboard and successfully creates work orders with auto-SDC creation. Backend API testing achieved 100% success rate (12/12 tests passed). Frontend testing confirmed all key features working correctly.",
